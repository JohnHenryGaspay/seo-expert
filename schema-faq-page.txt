          "text": "A Return Policy often defines a company who they are, how they intend to do business. Unfortunately, we have become a society that buys and returns with little thought added to the mix. This is mostly the fault of the large commerce sites that make it easy to buy and even easier to return. Remember, someone has to pay for all those returns- and that is all of us, in the form of higher prices. At Springtree Media Group, we refuse to do business like this. Our associates are field experienced, and available to discuss and answer your questions. They are never hurried, never on commission, and have no incentive to sell anything. In fact, in describing what we do at Springtree, I often say that we do not sell anything. We just connect people with the best tools to accomplish their task. If we did not do our job correctly and what you ordered did not accomplish the task, we will gladly take it back.If you just ordered something and asked no questions, we assume you did all of the research.  We may take it back and we might not.  A restocking fee of 0 to 20 percent may apply depending on the nature of the item.  In doubt,  Call and ask first. For most substantial orders consisting of larger quantities, we offer a demo program where you can buy a sample quantity at a reduced price with a full refund guarantee. That way you know if it’s going to work for you.  If it does, you just saved some money if it doesn’t, send it back for a full refund. You can find the individual offers listed on the product description pages.  Did it arrive defective or broken?  We will make it right- immediately and on our dime.  Has an item failed within the warranty period? We will do everything we can to remedy the situation. Different manufacturers offer different warranties, so ask before you buy. Bottomline:  We want our customers happy and will do every reasonable thing we can to ensure this. If you prefer to just order online with no interaction, then we are probably not your best choice. Peter Vaque CEO Springtree Media Group"

          "text": "Wall Stations are the easiest way to control your lights for everyday use! Wall Stations are wall mounted DMX scene recorders, with 8 or 16 buttons, that let you save a specific scene to each one of those buttons. They are the perfect solution for volunteer-heavy facilities, like churches and schools, where the most used scenes can be reached without needing to use a lighting console."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The most likely reason is that your Wall Station is not receiving DMX. If you are in program mode, and the light is GREEN, your Wall Station is not receiving DMX. There are two things to consider;(1.)Is your wall station the first thing in your DMX chain out of your console?  (2.) Make sure your connections are good going in to the phoenix connector, double check that pins 2 and 3 are not backwards. A RED light will illuminate when the unit is receiving DMX."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wall Stations become inoperable whenever they sense DMX coming from the console. So when you need to use your console for a service or event, your light show won’t be ruined by someone clicking a Wall Station button. Many computers running lighting software will continuously send out a DMX signal, making your Wall Station inoperable. Shutting down and closing out of your lighting software should solve this problem. If you are wanting to keep your computer up and running while using Wall Stations, we offer a Console Switch for $39.95. Console Switches are just an easy to use switch that allows your manually switch control back-and-forth between your computer and Wall Station."
